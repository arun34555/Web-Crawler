# Web-Crawler
Creating a web crawler for LinkedIn’s public profiles or company pages requires careful planning to respect LinkedIn’s terms of service. Automated scraping of LinkedIn is against their policies, and doing so without proper permissions may result in legal repercussions or IP bans.

That said, here's how to approach this responsibly:

Steps to Develop a Web Crawler
Compliance and Permissions:

Ensure the tool operates within the guidelines of LinkedIn's terms of service.
Consider using LinkedIn's public API for data retrieval where possible.
Technology Stack:

Python: For programming the crawler.
BeautifulSoup/Scrapy: For web scraping.
Requests: For handling HTTP requests.
Selenium: For dynamic content rendering (if necessary).
Basic Anti-Bot Measures:

Use rotating proxies.
Randomize headers and user-agents.
Include delays between requests.
Limit request frequency.
Output Format:

Export the extracted data to JSON, CSV, or a database.
